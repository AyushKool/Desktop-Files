/*
A stack can be implemented by using two queues. Let stack to be implemented be 's' and queues
used to implement be 'q1' and 'q2'. Stack 's' can be implemented in two ways:

Method 1 (By making push operation costly):
This method makes sure that newly entered element is always at the front of 'q1', so that pop operation just dequeues from 'q1'
'q2' is used to put every new element at front of 'q1'
